# Knight's Tour Web App

Welcome to the **Knight's Tour** – a classic chess puzzle implemented as an interactive web application.

This project allows users to manually explore all legal knight moves on a standard 8×8 chessboard, aiming to visit every square exactly once without repeating. It’s a fun and educational way to understand how the knight piece moves and to practice logic and planning.
